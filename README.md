# React App

We need react application for the internal dashboard interactivity. So for now, I am going to move different sections to different branches

# Spring Boot backend

The backend of this application is being created in Spring boot java. The IDE i am currently using is Spring-tool-suit for Spring boot. 

# Branches 

* main branch will only hold the final release (yet not decided how to make it single release)
* react branch will hold the react application code
* boot branch will hold the spring boot backend
